This is a tileserver written for Node.JS that works with the rest of the Tirex
system.

This is not recommended for production system. It just has the basics for a
tile server and does seem to work, but lacks things such as proper logging.
And its pretty new and basically untested.

See http://www.nodejs.org/ for downloading and installing NodeJS. You need a
reasonably new version that supports UDP. The version in Ubuntu 10.10 doesn't
work.

Start it with
    node tileserver.js

It will read your Tirex configuration in /etc/tirex and look for maps there.
It will then open port 9320 and listen for map requests. URLs have the form

    http://HOST:9320/tiles/MAP/Z/X/Y.png

You can ask

    http://HOST:9320/maps

for a list of maps it knows about and

    http://HOST:9320/stats

for statistics.
