Description: Tirex sync daemon
 The Tirex suite of programs manages map tile rendering and caching.
 This is the sync daemon which listens for messages of tiles fully rendered,
 and then copies the metatile to another server. The sync daemon is intended
 to be used in setups where you have multiple tile servers with their own
 rendering queues.
