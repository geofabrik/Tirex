Tirex Bugs
==========

* There are config options metatile_rows and metatile_columns and defaults for
  those settings in the Perl code as $Tirex::METATILE_ROWS and
  $Tirex::METATILE_COLUMNS. Some Tirex code looks into the config, some uses the
  variables above and some has hardcoded dependencies on metatile size.  Nobody
  has ever tested Tirex with sizes other than 8x8. Especially non-quadratic
  metatiles will probably not work at all.
