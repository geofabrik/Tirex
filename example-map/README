This is some simple test data to test Mapnik with Tirex.

The data is from http://www.naturalearthdata.com/, it is in the Public Domain.
It was slightly changed to work with mercator projection.

Note that it will only work in low zoom levels, if you zoom in you'll get
problems at some point because the polygons are to big.
